Text-Based Question Answering System using Pattern Matching

# Text-Based Question Answering System (AI Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a simple Artificial Intelligence system that answers questions by matching predefined patterns in a given text. It demonstrates early AI techniques based on template matching and text substitution.

## 🧠 Concept Used
- Pattern Matching
- Text Substitution
- Rule-Based AI
- String Processing

## 🛠 Technologies
- Python

## 📂 Project Structure
- text_qa_ai.py → Main Python code
- README.md → Project documentation

## ▶ How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Run the file:
3. Enter a question related to the text.

## 🧪 Example
**Question:** What did Mary buy  
**Answer:** a new coat

## ⚠ Limitations
- Cannot understand meaning
- Depends strictly on predefined patterns
- Cannot handle complex language

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Understanding early AI systems
- Importance of pattern matching
- Why modern AI uses Machine Learning and NLP
